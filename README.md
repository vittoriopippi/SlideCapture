# SlideCapture
SlideCapture is a simple script that analyze a video and extract the slides rafigured from it. In order to avoid that every frame of the video is saved, the scipt calculate the difference between the frames and save the slide only when there are some changes.

### What you can do

![Sample slide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vittoriopippi/SlideCapture/master/images/slide.png?token=AGXIYW5EAY4REDSYDVFHMLK6THQTA)

and when in the video the slide changes the script will save the next slide.
